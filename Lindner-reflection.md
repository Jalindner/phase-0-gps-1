# Lindner's Reflection

* It was overwhelming at first to juggle the dynamics of managing branches both local and remote at the same time. It eventually lead to a merge error occuring prematurely during the session.

* How to better display command prompt and how to properly manage and merge branches.

* How to make a better display for GPS. What commands should be done on what branches.

* Why choose between cloning or fetching.

* Despite the struggles and initial nervousness, this was very fun and an engaging way to collaborate with fellow cohorts to work around a problem.
