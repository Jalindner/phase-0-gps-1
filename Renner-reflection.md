What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I wasn't always sure what certain commands meant.  I just knew when to use them.  With the (git push origin master) I didn't know what the 'origin' part was for.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Thankfully Bison was more than helpful on telling me what a lot of the commands meant that I didn't understand but just knew when to use.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

John and I asked a lot of syntax and process questions mainly. 

What still confuses you about Git?

Fetching versus pulling. (With a YES from John when I said my answer haha) We actually had a merge conflict before the orchestrated one, and we did what GitHub told us to and we still aren't sure how we fixed it but we did.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was nice to work on a team instead of having to rely soley on my own knowledge and research to resolve problems.  Between John, myself, and a little help from Bison we were able to troubleshoot better than when I am working alone.
